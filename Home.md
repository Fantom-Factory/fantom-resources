## Wiki features

This wiki uses the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

The wiki itself is actually a mercurial repository, which means you can clone it, edit it locally/offline, add images or any other file type, and push it back to us. It will be live immediately.

Go ahead and try:

```
$ hg clone https://fantomfactory@bitbucket.org/fantomfactory/wiki/wiki
```

Wiki pages are normal files, with the .md extension. You can edit them locally, as well as creating new ones.
